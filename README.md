# Capstone-Project
Fruits Quality Inspection System using Yolo
The purpose of this project is Vision-based fruit quality inspection that uses computer 
vision and Object Detection to evaluate the quality of fruits. The process involves 
capturing images of fruits using cameras, analyzing the images to identify defects, and 
grading the fruits based on the physical characteristics, such as color, texture, size, and 
shape. This method can accurately and efficiently assess fruit quality, enabling 
producers to make informed decisions on harvesting, storage, and distribution. 
Moreover, this technique is also used by food industries for many purposes such as 
sorting and grading, package inspection and label verification.

Fruit quality inspection System is an object detection-based project, that use Yolo 
algorithms to evaluate the quality of fruits. The process involves capturing images of 
fruits using cameras, analyzing the images to identify defects, and grading the fruits 
based on the physical characteristics. This method can accurately and efficiently assess 
fruit quality, enabling producers to make informed decisions on harvesting, storage, and 
distribution. Computer vision-based fruit quality inspection systems are becoming 
increasingly popular in the agriculture industry as they offer a reliable and efficient way 
to inspect fruit quality. Some common applications include sorting and grading of fruits, 
detecting defects such as bruises and insect damage, and measuring ripeness.The 
proposed "Computer Vision Based Fruit Quality Inspection System" aims to address the 
inefficiencies and inconsistencies in traditional fruit quality assessment methods. By 
leveraging advanced computer vision techniques, the system can accurately and rapidly 
evaluate various quality parameters such as color, size, shape, and defects.
